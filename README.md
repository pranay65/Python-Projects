# Python Projects

This repository includes a collection of Python projects built with Tkinter for GUI functionality and developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Each project is interactive, with a simple yet effective interface that allows users to perform a range of tasks, from calculations to games.


### Area Calculator
Calculates the area of different geometric shapes based on user input. The application is designed to make shape selection and input handling easy through a graphical interface.

### Bill Generator
Simulates a billing system where users can input items, quantities, and prices. The application calculates totals and provides a simple invoice-style output, demonstrating Tkinter’s ability to manage multiple data fields effectively.

### Calculator
A calculator with arithmetic and trigonometric functions. This project highlights Tkinter’s grid layout for positioning buttons in a calculator format.

### Number Game
A number guessing game where users have 7 attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, showing how Tkinter can update the interface in response to user input.

### Word Game
Inspired by Wordle, this word-guessing game allows users a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word, with hints provided after each attempt. Tkinter's widgets are used for input and feedback, and OOP is employed to manage game logic.

## Features

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Each project uses Tkinter to create a graphical interface, making the applications intuitive and accessible without needing command-line interaction. Tkinter widgets like buttons, labels, entry fields, and text areas are widely used across all projects.

**Object-Oriented Design:** The code for each project follows OOP principles to ensure modularity and reusability. Classes are used to encapsulate functionality, making it easy to extend or modify individual components. For example, the Bill Generator uses classes to represent different objects.

**Event-Driven Programming:** Tkinter’s event-handling capabilities are utilized to respond to user actions in real-time. For instance, in the Number Game, each guess triggers an event that processes the input and updates the feedback on the interface.
